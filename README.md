This is the project that showcases me learning Nextjs 13. Web development is incredibly complex, despite the fact that I'm using so many external libraries. 

There's no relational database in this project because that wasn't really the point of me building it. Instead I've got hard coded lists in the constants folder as well as API's 

I built this in accordance to a youtube course by JavaScipt Mastery, and I learned a LOT about nextjs and web development. I plan on doing a few more in the coming weeks 

start this with npm run dev in your terminal then go to localhost://3000
